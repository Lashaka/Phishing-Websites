## Guide for Creating a USA Government Phishing Website:
1. Use separate, unlinked accounts and a VPN when accessing them.
2. Utilize a form submission tool, such as https://www.actionforms.io/, to have form submissions sent to you and redirect the user to the real website after submission.
3. Go to line 71 in the code, Replace the current link in the action attribute of the form with the desired endpoint for your request.
4. Host the website on a hosting platform, such as https://app.infinityfree.net/accounts, with a domain name as similar as possible to the original.
5. Utilize a URL shortener, such as https://bitly.com/, if the domain name does not closely match the original.
6. Prior to distributing the website, thoroughly test it to ensure it is not detected as malicious. If it is flagged, consider modifying the domain name to make it less similar to the original website.
7. The website is now ready to be distributed, and you will receive any form submissions.
